Follow the instructions on https://www.openshift.org[Try Origin,window=_blank]. We use the https://www.openshift.org/vm[all-in-one VM,window=_blank] approach through a Vagrant VirtualBox VM

After you have installed Vagrant and VirtualBox, run:

----
$ vagrant init openshift/origin-all-in-one
$ vagrant up --provider=virtualbox
...
Successfully started and provisioned VM with 2 cores and 5 G of memory.
To modify the number of cores and/or available memory modify your local Vagrantfile

You can now access the OpenShift console on: https://10.2.2.2:8443/console[https://10.2.2.2:8443/console,window=_blank]

Configured users are:

a new user.
